                    <p class="card-text">Pulmo is an undergraduate thesis project created by a student named <strong>Teguh Satya</strong>. This project is coded with love using python, supported with python flask framework (for web development) and bootstrap 4 (for the front-end). Pulmo is a website that will give user the association rules based on the dataset that the user input. The association rules is calculated using Apriori Algorithm, then transferred to the website using flaskframework. The original purpose of Pulmo is to give the pattern of respiratory disease of an active smoker. But still, it can be use to any given dataset, as long as it's compatible enough to do the algorithm such as a market-basket dataset etc.</p>
